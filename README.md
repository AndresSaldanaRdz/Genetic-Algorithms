# Genetic-Algorithms
Various genetic algorithms coded from scratch for different optimization problems 

The first genetic algorithm was used to solve a typical "supply-demand" style problem, where N numbers of stores are in charge of supplying M numbers of clients.
The algorithm revolved around finding a combination of different quantities of product M store should send to N client, to reach the lowest possible cost.

The second genetic algorithm is for a typical traveling salesman problem. Where a salesman starts in X city and has to visit M number of cities at least once and return home.
The problem lies in finding the best order to visit the cities to reduce the cost of traveling, after 1000 generations (5 seconds) the algorithm found an optimal solution.
